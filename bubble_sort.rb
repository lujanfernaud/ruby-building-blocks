# Project: Bubble Sort for The Odin Project
# Author: Luj√°n Fernaud
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1. Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a
# sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be
# pretty pointless, wouldn't it?).
#
# 2. Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array
# but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent
# the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block's return
# will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before -- if
# the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is "smaller"
# than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means
# the left element is greater. Use this to sort your array.
