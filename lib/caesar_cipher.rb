# Project: Caesar Cipher for The Odin Project

# Instructions: Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string
# and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.
# Don't forget to keep the same case.

    character_array = build_character_array(character_bytes, character)
    new_character = find_new_character(character_array, character, shift_factor)
    new_string << new_character.chr
  end

  new_string

# Select only the sub array that contains 'character' to keep the same case.
