# Project: Caesar Cipher for The Odin Project
# Author: Luj√°n Fernaud
#
# Instructions: Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor
# and then outputs the modified string. Don't forget to keep the same case.

  # Characters in range 65..90 are lowercase and in range 97..122 are uppercase.

    # Select only the sub array that contains 'character' to keep the same case.
    character_array = character_bytes.select { |sub_array| sub_array.include?(character) }.flatten

                        character_position      = character_array.index(character)
